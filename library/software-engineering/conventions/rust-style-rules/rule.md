When you write or change Rust code in this project:

**Tooling**
- Code must pass `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --all-targets` with no warnings under the project's lint settings.
- Never silence a lint crate-wide. Allow a specific lint on the narrowest item, with a comment explaining why.
- Use the edition and minimum Rust version in `Cargo.toml`. Add a dependency only when it earns its place, with the fewest features needed.

**Ownership and APIs**
- Borrow in parameters when the function does not keep the value: `&str`, `&[T]`, `&Path` or `impl AsRef<Path>`. Take ownership (`String`, `Vec<T>`) when the value is stored.
- Do not add `.clone()` just to satisfy the borrow checker. Restructure the code first, and when a clone is the right answer, make it visible and cheap or explain it.
- Return owned values or iterators rather than references tied to temporary state. Use `Cow` when a value is only sometimes owned.
- Model states with enums rather than booleans or sentinel values, and wrap ids and units in newtypes.
- Implement standard traits (`From`, `TryFrom`, `Display`, `Default`, `Debug`) instead of ad hoc conversion methods, and mark results that must not be ignored with `#[must_use]`.

**Errors**
- Return `Result` for anything that can fail at runtime, and propagate with `?`.
- Do not call `unwrap()` in library or request-handling code. Use `expect("reason this cannot fail")` only for real invariants.
- Follow the project's error approach. Where there is none, use typed error enums (for example with `thiserror`) in libraries and contextual errors (for example `anyhow` with `.context(...)`) in binaries.
- Never panic across an FFI boundary or in a `Drop` implementation.

**Unsafe**
- Avoid `unsafe`. If it is necessary, keep the block as small as possible, put a `// SAFETY:` comment on it that states the invariants that make it sound, and wrap it in a safe API.
- Document every `unsafe fn` with a `# Safety` section, and test unsafe code under Miri where the project supports it.

**Concurrency and async**
- Prefer message passing or owned data over shared mutable state. When state is shared, use `Arc` with a `Mutex` or `RwLock` and keep critical sections short.
- Never hold a `std::sync::Mutex` guard across `.await`. Use the runtime's async mutex or restructure.
- Never block inside async code. Move blocking or CPU-heavy work to `spawn_blocking` or a dedicated thread.

**Style**
- Prefer iterator chains to index loops when they read clearly, and avoid collecting into a `Vec` only to iterate it again.
- Keep items private by default, and use `pub(crate)` before `pub`.
- Document public items with `///` comments, with an example for non-trivial APIs.
- Put unit tests in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` beside the code, and integration tests in `tests/`.
