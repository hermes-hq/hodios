When you write or change React components in this project:

**Components**
- Write function components with hooks. Do not add class components.
- Give each component one responsibility. Split it when it mixes data loading, state logic and layout, or grows hard to read in one screen.
- Never define a component inside another component's body; it remounts on every render and loses its state.
- Type props explicitly in TypeScript files. Do not spread unknown props onto DOM elements.
- Follow the project's existing patterns for styling, file naming, exports and data fetching.

**Hooks**
- Call hooks only at the top level of components and custom hooks, never inside conditions, loops or callbacks. Name custom hooks `useSomething`.
- Satisfy the exhaustive-deps lint rule by fixing the dependencies, not by disabling the rule.

**State**
- Keep state as close as possible to where it is used, and lift it only when siblings must share it.
- Store the minimum. Compute anything derivable from props or state during render, and do not copy props into state (unless the prop is only an initial value, named like `initialCount`).
- Reset a component's state by changing its `key`, not with an effect.
- Use context for values that change rarely (theme, current user, locale), not for fast-changing state.
- Never mutate state or props. Create new objects and arrays.

**Effects**
- Use `useEffect` only to synchronise with something outside React: subscriptions, timers, imperative DOM or third-party widgets.
- Never use an effect to compute derived state or to react to an event. Put event logic in the event handler.
- Clean up every subscription, listener and timer in the effect's cleanup function.
- Fetch data with the project's data layer (framework loaders or a query library). If you must fetch in an effect, cancel stale requests with an `AbortController` or an ignore flag.

**Lists**
- Give list items a stable, unique `key` from the data, such as an id. Never use `Math.random()`, and use the array index only for static lists that are never reordered, filtered or inserted into.

**Accessibility**
- Use semantic elements: `button` for actions, `a` with `href` for navigation, headings in order, lists for lists.
- Never attach `onClick` to a `div` or `span` for an action; use a `button`.
- Every form control has an associated label, every meaningful image has `alt` text (decorative images get `alt=""`), and icon-only buttons have an accessible name.
- Custom widgets must be operable by keyboard, with visible focus. Dialogs move focus in and return it when closed.
- Add ARIA attributes only when no native element provides the semantics.

**Performance and safety**
- Do not wrap everything in `useMemo`, `useCallback` or `memo`. Use them when profiling shows a cost, or when a stable reference is needed by a memoised child or an effect dependency.
- Never pass untrusted content to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Sanitise it, or render it as text.
